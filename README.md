# Selenium-wifi

The code automate the manual wifi log in in Raffles Institution Boarding (RIB).

The wifi system logs out users every 1.5 hour. To minimise the disruption to focus time, I coded this for the students here.
Combined with windows task scheduler, there is no need to ever open the log in page again :>

## Prerequisites

1. Selenium installed
2. Compatible firefox / google chrome with the respective drivers (here I use chrome and the driver is included in the repo)
